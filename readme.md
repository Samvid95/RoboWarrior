There are a couple of things I want to mention which are part of the challenge: 
1. All the 4 animations that are provided has been used in game by using Robot as the playable character. 
2. I have created a shader which add the border and give the functionality to change the color but I was unable to find a suitable place to use it so I currently have it on the bullet but you can find that Shader in the Art folder.
3. This game has full game loop with a narrative behind it. 

In the email I sent to Fumiaki(Thank you for solving my doubts instantly :-) ) I have included a build of the game as well so you can try that out. 

In the project you can find the "Start" scene in the Scene folder which you can try and play the game from. 

All of the arts are either owned by me or under CC license. 

Future Works: 
The things I really wanted to add but not able to because of the time crunch is adding Sounds Effects and a Boss level so that will be my future works. 

Note:
From the reviews I found that the game is actually pretty hard in the beginnning when you play it for the first couple of times but it gets easier after a while so try playing the game a few times and you will get a hang of it and can win it.
